**Ilham Tycoon** is a web-based simulation platform designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of Cryptography and Blockchain Economics (GameFi). Built as a final project for the Cryptography course, this application simulates a closed-loop economy involving Token Mining, Staking (DeFi), NFT Crafting, and Asset Trading.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. ⛏️ Mining Simulation (Proof-of-Work Concept)
* **Manual Mining:** Users click to "mine" **Ilham Game Coin (IGC)**. This simulates the computational effort required to validate blocks.
* **Visual Feedback:** Particle effects and animations represent the hashing process.
* **Auto-Mining:** Purchase "Trading Bots" to automate the mining process, simulating passive node validation.

### 2. 🏦 Staking Vault (Proof-of-Stake Concept)
* **DeFi Simulation:** Users can lock their IGC tokens into a smart vault.
* **APY Calculation:** The system calculates passive rewards based on the staked amount and time elapsed, demonstrating the *Time Value of Money* and validator incentives.

### 3. 🛒 Black Market (Token Utility)
* **Trading Bots:** Purchase automated miners (Basic Trader, Algo Trader, Whale Tracker).
* **Smart Contract Logic:** Simulates a transaction where tokens are burned (deducted) in exchange for feature access (state updates).

### 4. ⚒️ The Forge (NFT & Crafting)
* **Asset Fusion:** Combine two basic items (e.g., Raw Silicon + Fan) to mint a new, rarer asset (e.g., Super GPU).
* **Minting Animation:** Visualizes the creation of new digital assets on the blockchain.

### 5. 🏆 Gamification
* **Achievements:** Badges unlock based on milestones (e.g., "Novice Miner" at 1000 clicks).
* **Leaderboard:** Displays top miners to simulate network competition.
* **Persistency:** Mock wallet connection (`0x...`) simulation.
